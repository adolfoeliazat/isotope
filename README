 This is a project management application. :) Huh.. Please dont ask me Why I am wasting time.

 I am trying to develop this application based on the user perspective rather than looking into it as a
 member of a project.

 Obiviously it is more or like Redmine,unfuddle or basecamp. Actually I am trying to make something which has all the features of the above.

 Lets see How long I am looking on this. Currently you can do the following

 * Create project with fully supported git integration
      I use grit for accessing the git. I think a part of unfuddle is done
 
 *  tickets ,Messages, keys for importing to git ( most part of unfuddle option)

 * GTD ( to know more about that pls look on wikipedia )

 Still lot more have to be done. :)
